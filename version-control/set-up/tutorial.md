## Before you begin
Install command line Git for your operating system ([OS X](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/), [Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/) or [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)) and open your terminal / command prompt.

Download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (for Mac or Windows).

Create a directory where you will be storing all your projects. You can call it `code` or `projects`.

### Setup your Git details

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "name@domain"
```

### Setup an SSH key

An SSH key is used to identify trusted computers, without entering a password.
